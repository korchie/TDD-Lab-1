TDD LAB 1

Intro: Pig Latin is a children’s word game in English where starting consonants are flipped to the ends of words and -ay added to each word.  Hello World would be ellohay orldway in Pig Latin, for instance.  Many languages have games similar to this--read more at http://mentalfloss.com/article/50242/pig-latins-11-other-languages 

Task: Use TDD practices to build a function that translates from English to Pig Latin.

Build Specifications
1. Translation must all be done in a translate function that takes a string parameter and returns the translated Pig Latin string.
2. The translation functionality must be developed with TDD using tests on the translate function.
3. If desired, you may also create other helper functions and optionally test them.

Additional Build Specifications
1. Convert each word to lowercase before translating.
2. If a word starts with a vowel, just add “way” onto the ending.
3. If a word starts with a consonant, move all of the consonants that appear before the first vowel to the end of the word, then add “ay” to the end of the word.

Hints
-Treat “y” as a consonant.
-Start with the simplest cases and work up, for example…
    a. words that start with vowels… write tests for several different starting vowels
    b. words that start with vowels with capital letters are converted to lowercase
    c. words that start with one consonant… write tests for the second letter being several different vowels
    d. words that start with two consonants
    e. words that start with more consonants
